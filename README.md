# EDLP

EDLP is the insatiable design document processor used to convert engineering design files to a data tree ready to be refined.

Yeah, there isn't much here at the moment, but feel free to share your ideas!


## Usage

Install EDLP using Go: 

``` bash 
go get github.com/jh2119/edlp
```

Compile EDLP with Go:

``` bash 
# see the makefile for the actual commands
cd github.com/jh2119/edlp
make
```
